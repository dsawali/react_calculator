Home Tab:
- Implements React Rotation animations on React logos.

Calculator Tab:
- The calculator will have the following inputs:
    - digits 0-9
    - 'AC', '+/-', '%', '/', 'X', '-', '+', '='
    - previous answer

Todo-List:
- Implements a simple task list tool with flow motion transitions on adds and deletes.

React Router:

NOTE: 
We are using create-react-app to set up my development environment:
https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html
The source code for the component is within:
calculator_component/src/

Troubleshooting:
- When starting to work with this app always run npm install in a new environment
- If this does not work, try to delete package-lock.json and then re-run npm install.
